# HR-Analytics-Dashboard

#here is a detailed description and analysis of the HR Analytics Dashboard.

#Overall Description
This is a strategic HR Analytics Dashboard designed to provide a comprehensive overview of employee attrition (turnover) within an organization. The primary goal is to help HR professionals and management identify the key drivers and patterns behind employee departures. The dashboard consolidates key metrics and breaks down attrition by various critical dimensions such as gender, education, age, job role, salary, and tenure.

#Detailed Analysis of Dashboard Components
1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs - Top Section)
This section provides a high-level snapshot of the workforce and the attrition problem.
Overall Employees: 1,470 - The total headcount in the dataset.
Attrition: 238 - The raw number of employees who have left the company. This is the core issue being analyzed.
Attrition Rate: 16.2% - This is the most critical metric, showing that nearly one in six employees has left. This is a very high attrition rate that would be a major concern for any business.
Avg Age: 37 - The average age of the workforce, indicating a relatively experienced employee base.
Avg Salary: $6.5K - Likely represents the average monthly salary. This provides a benchmark for compensation analysis.
Years at Company: 7.0 - The average tenure of employees, which is fairly high, suggesting that attrition might be hitting newer hires harder or that long-serving employees are also leaving.

#2. Attrition by Demographic & Education
These charts help understand who is leaving.
Attrition by Gender: The chart shows the count of males and females who have left. It appears that male attrition is significantly higher than female attrition in this organization.
Attrition by Education: The largest proportion of employees who left come from the Life Sciences field (37%), followed by Medical (26%) and Marketing (15%). This points to a potential issue in retaining talent in these specific educational backgrounds.

#3. Attrition by Job & Compensation
These visuals are crucial for identifying functional and financial pain points.
Attrition by Job Role: This is one of the most revealing charts.
Sales Representatives have the highest attrition (62), followed by Laboratory Technicians (58) and Research Scientists (47).
This clearly identifies these three roles as "at-risk" positions that require immediate management attention.
Attrition by Salary Slab: There is a very clear and strong inverse relationship between salary and attrition.
The vast majority of attrition (49%) comes from the lowest salary slab (Up to $5K).
As the salary increases, attrition drops dramatically, with the $15k+ slab seeing only 5% attrition.
This is a powerful indicator that compensation is a major driver of attrition.

#4. Attrition by Tenure & Age
These charts show when employees are leaving.
Attrition by Years At Company: This chart shows that attrition is highest among employees with less than 5 years of tenure. This is a classic pattern, often related to onboarding, cultural fit, or early-career development not meeting expectations. There is another, smaller peak around the 15-year mark, which could be related to mid-career crises or stagnation.
Attrition by Age: The youngest age group (20-35) experiences the highest level of attrition. This aligns with the "Years at Company" data, suggesting that the company is struggling to retain younger, newer talent.

#Summary of Key Insights and Conclusions
A Critical Attrition Problem: The 16.2% attrition rate is alarmingly high and likely incurring significant costs in recruitment, training, and lost productivity.
Compensation is a Primary Driver: The strong correlation between low salary and high attrition suggests that the company may not be competitively compensating its employees, especially in entry-level and junior positions.
Key Risk Roles: The company is losing a critical mass of its Sales, Laboratory, and Research staff. This could directly impact revenue, product development, and innovation.
Retention of Young Talent is Failing: The data clearly shows that employees who are younger (20-35) and newer (0-5 years) are leaving at the highest rates. This indicates potential failures in the recruitment process, onboarding, initial job placement, or career progression paths for young professionals.
Focus Areas for Men and Specific Fields: The higher attrition among men and employees with Life Sciences and Medical educations warrants a deeper investigation into departmental culture, management styles, or industry competitiveness for these groups.

#In conclusion,
this dashboard effectively highlights a serious retention crisis. It provides clear, data-driven directions for HR and management to take action, starting with a review of compensation structures for early-career roles and a focused retention strategy for the high-attrition job families of Sales, Laboratory, and Research.
